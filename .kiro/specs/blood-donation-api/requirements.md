# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a blood donation management web service API built with FastAPI. The system will manage information about blood donors, blood requests, and hospitals, enabling efficient matching between donors and those in need of blood. The API will follow REST principles and communicate using JSON format, providing a backend service for mobile apps, websites, or other client applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage donor information, so that I can maintain an accurate database of available blood donors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new donor registration request is received THEN the system SHALL store donor information including name, blood group, city, and contact details
2. WHEN a request to view all donors is made THEN the system SHALL return a list of all registered donors in JSON format
3. WHEN a search request is made with blood group criteria THEN the system SHALL return only donors matching that blood group
4. WHEN a search request is made with city criteria THEN the system SHALL return only donors from that specific city
5. WHEN a donor update request is received THEN the system SHALL modify the existing donor record with new information
6. WHEN a donor deletion request is received THEN the system SHALL remove the donor record from the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hospital or patient representative, I want to create and manage blood requests, so that I can find suitable donors for patients in need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new blood request is submitted THEN the system SHALL store request details including blood group, patient name, city, and urgency level
2. WHEN a request to view all active blood requests is made THEN the system SHALL return a list of unfulfilled requests in JSON format
3. WHEN a request for donor matching is made THEN the system SHALL return a list of suitable donors based on blood group and city compatibility
4. WHEN a blood request is marked as fulfilled THEN the system SHALL update the request status to prevent further matching

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want to interact with the system through REST APIs, so that I can integrate blood donation functionality into various platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL respond with properly formatted JSON data
2. WHEN a GET request is made to retrieve data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and response bodies
3. WHEN a POST request is made to create new records THEN the system SHALL validate input data and return success or error responses
4. WHEN a PUT request is made to update records THEN the system SHALL modify existing data and confirm the update
5. WHEN a DELETE request is made THEN the system SHALL remove the specified record and confirm deletion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all data to be persistently stored, so that information is retained between system restarts and sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN donor information is added THEN the system SHALL store it in a SQLite database
2. WHEN blood request information is created THEN the system SHALL persist it in the database
3. WHEN the system is restarted THEN all previously stored data SHALL remain accessible
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an end user, I want search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find relevant donors or requests based on specific criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering donors by blood group THEN the system SHALL return only donors with matching blood type
2. WHEN filtering donors by city THEN the system SHALL return only donors from that location
3. WHEN combining blood group and city filters THEN the system SHALL return donors meeting both criteria
4. WHEN filtering requests by urgency level THEN the system SHALL return requests with specified priority
5. WHEN no results match the filter criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty list with appropriate status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want a simple web dashboard interface, so that I can visually interact with the blood donation system without needing external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web dashboard THEN the system SHALL serve HTML pages that display donor and request information
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN users SHALL be able to see lists of all donors and blood requests
3. WHEN using the web interface THEN users SHALL be able to add new donors through web forms
4. WHEN using the web interface THEN users SHALL be able to create new blood requests through web forms
5. WHEN interacting with the dashboard THEN all operations SHALL communicate with the FastAPI backend through the REST endpoints
